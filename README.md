# CloudFLow
This project consists of two Jenkins pipelines for managing the infrastructure and deploying applications to an Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment. The first pipeline focuses on building and managing the infrastructure, including networking components, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters, and Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repositories. The second pipeline is responsible for building application images, pushing them to ECR, and deploying Kubernetes YAML files to the EKS cluster.
## Prerequisites

Before getting started with these Jenkins pipelines, you need to have the following prerequisites in place:

   1. AWS Account: You must have an AWS account to deploy resources in AWS.

   2. Jenkins Server: You should have a Jenkins server set up and running. Ensure you have the necessary plugins installed for AWS interactions, Git, Docker, and Kubernetes.

   3. AWS CLI: The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) should be installed and configured on your Jenkins server with the necessary permissions.

   4. Terraform: Install Terraform on your Jenkins server to manage infrastructure as code. You can download it from https://www.terraform.io/.

   5. Kubectl: Install kubectl to interact with the Kubernetes cluster. You can find installation instructions at https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/.

   6. Docker: Ensure Docker is installed on your Jenkins server for building and pushing Docker images.

## Jenkins Pipelines
### 1. Infrastructure Pipeline

The Infrastructure pipeline focuses on building and managing the AWS infrastructure. It includes the creation of networking components, an EKS cluster, and ECR repositories.
#### Pipeline Stages:

* Initialize: Initialize Terraform and configure AWS credentials.

* Network Infrastructure: Create the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), public subnets, private subnets, Internet Gateway (IGW), Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway, and route tables using Terraform modules.

* EKS Cluster: Provision an EKS cluster using Terraform and configure kubectl to interact with it.

* ECR Repositories: Create ECR repositories to store Docker images.

* Clean Up: Optionally, add a cleanup stage to delete the infrastructure if needed.

### 2. Application Deployment Pipeline

The Application Deployment pipeline is responsible for building Docker images, pushing them to ECR, and deploying applications to the EKS cluster.
Pipeline Stages:

* Checkout Code: Clone the application source code from a Git repository.

* Build Docker Images: Build Docker images for the application components.

* Push to ECR: Push the built Docker images to their respective ECR repositories.

* Deploy to EKS: Deploy Kubernetes YAML files to the EKS cluster using kubectl.

## Usage

1. Set up your Jenkins server with the required plugins and configurations.

1. Create two Jenkins pipelines, one for the Infrastructure and one for the Application Deployment. Use the provided Jenkinsfile examples or create your own based on your project structure.

1. Configure Jenkins pipeline parameters, including AWS credentials, ECR repository names, and other environment-specific variables.

1. Trigger the Infrastructure pipeline when you need to create or update the AWS infrastructure.

1. Trigger the Application Deployment pipeline when you need to build and deploy application components to the EKS cluster.

## Security Considerations

* Ensure that AWS credentials used by Jenkins pipelines have the minimum required permissions and follow AWS security best practices.

* Protect sensitive information such as AWS access keys and secrets. Consider using Jenkins credentials to securely manage these values.

* Regularly update and patch software and dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.

* Implement network security, such as security groups and IAM roles, to restrict access and permissions.
